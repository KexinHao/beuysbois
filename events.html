          <p>beuys bois headquarters are located in a building that is also a home to multiple organizations and individuals. As the newbies in the neighbourhood we felt strongly about introducing ourselves and our mission to the locals. We initiated a gathering on a rainy summer afternoon in the adjacent garden that allowed us to connect with the environment we now inhabit and the people that make it. We shared coffee, bread, and stories, paving the way for new relationships between members of beuys bois and our neighbours.</p>
